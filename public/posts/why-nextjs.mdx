For a short amount time in 2020 and at web development, front-end development to be specific. I really enjoy the structures and syntax of JSX. Even though there's a lot of opinions and debate towards using React and it's JSX syntax, I reasearch a lot and made my decision to use React.

### Why [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

I used react for a lot of my projects and came across to one of react's framework which is NextJS

The first thing I appreciate in Next is the automatic file routing. It automatically creates a route for you whenever you create a file inside the `pages` folder

### Serverless Function

Also the built-in serverless function that it provides is very helpful and I'm using it a lot for myself. It's one of the useful function of next for me

### Supported with React's Community Library

As it is a react framework, it benefits to the communities packages and also considers nextjs when building a package for react.

I really like the components and utilities that packages have and I enjoy using them in different kinds of scenarios.

### Conclusion

As the years goes by. I really loved the React ecosystem for the myself, I'm starting to learn Typescript with it as I saw the community recommend it and I'd like to see what I will do with it.
